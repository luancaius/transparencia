<h1>Project Transparencia</h1>

<p>This project was born as a way to test techniques to manage data flow and get insights using AI. It fetches real data from Brazil public services, cache it, saves on non-relational databases and later analyzes the data.</p>

- Updates: I'm moving to clean architecture, but the old project is fully functional. It fetches data related to deputy expenses and presence.
